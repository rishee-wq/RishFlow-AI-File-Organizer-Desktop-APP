The goal \nis to grasp the foundational hardware and its physical connections in \nbuilding a network. \n \nKey Devices & Components Covered \n1) Hub (Layer 1 \u2013 Physical Layer) \n \n\nAbout Hub: \nA hub is a basic networking device used to connect multiple \ncomputers in a LAN. It sends (broadcasts) the incoming data to all \nports, so every device receives the data even if it is meant for only \none device. This causes more traffic and collisions, so hubs are slower \nthan switches. \n2) Switch (Layer 2 \u2013 Data Link Layer) \n \nAbout Switch: \nA switch is an advanced device that connects multiple devices in a \nnetwork and forwards data only to the correct destination device \nusing MAC addresses. It reduces collisions and improves speed \ncompared to a hub. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3) Router (Layer 3 \u2013 Network Layer) \n \nAbout Router: \nA router connects different networks (example: your home network \nto the internet). It forwards data packets based on IP addresses and \nhelps in routing traffic efficiently. \n \n4) Modem (Modulator\u2013Demodulator) \n \nAbout Modem: \nA modem converts digital signals from your computer into analog \nsignals (and vice versa) so it can travel through ISP lines \n(telephone/fiber/cable). It is mainly used for internet connectivity. \n \n \n\n \n \n5) NIC (Network Interface Card) \n \nAbout NIC: \nA NIC is a hardware component that allows a computer to connect to \na network. It can be wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi). Every NIC \nhas a unique MAC address. \n \n6) Bridge (Layer 2 Device) \n \nAbout Bridge: \nA bridge connects two LAN segments and filters network traffic using \nMAC addresses. It helps reduce unnecessary traffic between \nsegments and improves performance. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n7) Gateway \n \nAbout Gateway: \nA gateway connects networks that use different protocols and works \nlike a translator between them. It is often the entry/exit point of a \nnetwork. \n \n8) RJ45 Crimping Tool + Cable Tester + RJ45 Connectors \n \nAbout Crimping Tool & RJ45: \nA crimping tool is used to attach an RJ45 connector to a UTP cable \n(Cat5/Cat6) to make Ethernet cables. Cable testers are used to check \nwhether the cable wiring is correct and working properly. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n "}
