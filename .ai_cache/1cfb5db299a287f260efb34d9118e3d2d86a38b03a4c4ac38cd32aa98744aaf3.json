Non-relational -\n\u2022 NoSQL databases never follow the relational model\n\u2022 Never provide tables with flat fixed-column records\n\u2022 Work with self-contained aggregates or BLOBs\n\u2022 Doesn't require object-relational mapping and data normalization\n2. Schema-free -\n\u2022 NoSQL databases are either schema-free or have relaxed schemas\n\u2022 Do not require any sort of definition of the schema of the data\nFeatures of NoSQL\n3. Simple API -\n\u2022 Offers easy to use interfaces for storage and querying data provided\n\u2022 APIs allow low-level data manipulation & selection methods\n\u2022 Text-based protocols mostly used with HTTP REST with JSON\n4. Distributed -\n\u2022 Multiple NoSQL databases can be executed in a distributed fashion\n\u2022 Offers auto-scaling and fail-over capabilities\n\u2022 Often ACID concept can be sacrificed for scalability and throughput\n\u2022 Only providing eventual consistency\n\u2022 Shared Nothing Architecture. This enables less coordination and higher \ndistribution.\nCategories of NoSQL\nThere are mainly four categories of NoSQL databases. Each of these categories \nhas its unique attributes and limitations.\nNo specific database is better to solve all problems. \n\u2022 Key-value Pair Based\n\u2022 Column-oriented Graph\n\u2022 Graphs based\n\u2022 Document-oriented\nKey Value Pair Based\n\u2022 Data is stored in key/value pairs. It is designed in such a way to handle lots of\ndata and heavy load.\n\u2022 Key-value pair storage databases store data as a hash table where each key is\nunique, and the value can be a JSON, BLOB(Binary Large Objects), string, etc.\n\u2022 It is one of the most basic types of NoSQL databases. This kind of NoSQL\ndatabase is used as a collection, dictionaries, associative arrays, etc. Key value\nstores help the developer to store schema-less data.\n\u2022 They work best for shopping cart contents.\n\u2022 Redis, Dynamo, Riak are some examples of key-value store Databases. They are\nall based on Amazon's Dynamo paper.\nKey Value Pair Based\n\nColumn-based\n\u2022 Column-oriented databases work on columns and are based on BigTable paper by\nGoogle.\n\u2022 Every column is treated separately. Values of single column databases are stored\ncontiguously.\n\u2022 They deliver high performance on aggregation queries like SUM, COUNT, AVG,\nMIN etc. as the data is readily available in a column.\n\u2022 Column-based NoSQL databases are widely used to manage data warehouses,\nbusiness intelligence, Library card catalogs,\n\u2022 HBase, Cassandra, HBase, Hypertable are examples of column based database.\nColumn-based\n\nDocument-Oriented\n\u2022 Document-Oriented NoSQL DB stores and retrieves data as a key value pair but\nthe value part is stored as a document.\n\u2022 The document is stored in JSON or XML formats. The value is understood by the\nDB and can be queried.\n\u2022 The document type is mostly used for CMS systems, blogging platforms, real-time\nanalytics & e-commerce applications.\n\u2022 It should not use for complex transactions which require multiple operations or\nqueries against varying aggregate structures.\nGraph-Based\n\u2022 A graph type database stores entities as well the relations amongst those\nentities.\n\u2022 The entity is stored as a node with the relationship as edges.\n\u2022 An edge gives a relationship between nodes. Every node and edge has a\nunique identifier.\n\u2022 Compared to a relational database where tables are loosely connected, a Graph\ndatabase is a multi-relational in nature.\n\u2022 Traversing relationship is fast as they are already captured into the DB, and\nthere is no need to calculate them.\n\u2022 Graph base database mostly used for social networks, logistics, spatial data.\n\u2022 Neo4J, Infinite Graph, OrientDB, FlockDB are some popular graph-based\ndatabases.\nGraph-Based\n\nCAP Theorem\n\u2022 CAP theorem is also called brewer's theorem. It states that is impossible for a \ndistributed data store to offer  more than two out of three guarantees\n\u2022 Consistency\n\u2022 Availability\n\u2022 Partition Tolerance\n\u2022 Consistency:\nThe data should remain consistent even after the execution of an operation. This \nmeans once data is written, any  future read request should contain that data. For \nexample, after updating the order status, all the clients should be able to see the \nsame data.\nCAP Theorem\n\u2022 Availability:\nThe database should always be available and responsive. It should not \nhave any downtime.\n\u2022 Partition Tolerance:\n\u2022 Partition Tolerance means that the system should continue to function even if the \ncommunication among the servers is not stable.\n\u2022 For example, the servers can be partitioned into multiple groups which may not \ncommunicate with each other. \n\u2022 Here, if part of the database is unavailable, other parts are always unaffected.\nBASE\n\nBASE\n\u2022 BASE: Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency\n\u2022 Basically, available means DB is available all the time as per CAP theorem\n\u2022 Soft state means even without an input; the system state may change\n\u2022 Eventual consistency means that the system will become consistent over time.\nBASE\n\u2022 Eventual Consistency - The term \"eventual consistency\" means to have copies \nof data on multiple machines to get high availability and scalability. Thus, \nchanges made to any data item on one machine has to be propagated to other \nreplicas.\n\u2022 Data replication may not be instantaneous as some copies will be updated \nimmediately while others in due course of time. These copies may be mutually, \nbut in due course of  time, they become consistent. Hence, the name eventual \nconsistency.\nAdvantages of NoSQL\n\u2022 Can be used as Primary or Analytic Data Source\n\u2022 Big Data Capability\n\u2022 No Single Point of Failure\n\u2022 Easy Replication\n\u2022 No Need for Separate Caching Layer\n\u2022 It provides fast performance and horizontal scalability.\n\u2022 Can handle structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data with equal effect\n\u2022 Object-oriented programming which is easy to use and flexible\n\u2022 NoSQL databases don't need a dedicated high-performance server\nCreate Database\nThe use Command\nMongoDB use DATABASE_NAME is used to create database. The command will \ncreate a new database if it doesn't exist, otherwise it will return the existing database.\nSyntax\nuse DATABASE_NAME\nDrop Database\nThe dropDatabase() Method\nMongoDB db.dropDatabase() command is used to drop a existing database.\nSyntax\ndb.dropDatabase()\nThis will delete the selected database. If you have not selected any database, then it \nwill delete default 'test' database.\nExample\n>use mydb\nswitched to db mydb\n>db.dropDatabase()\n>{ \"dropped\" : \"mydb\", \"ok\" : 1 }\nThe createCollection() Method\nMongoDB db.createCollection(name, options) is used to create collection.\nSyntax\ndb.createCollection(name, options)\nName String     Name of the collection to be created\nOptions Document  (Optional) Specify options about memory size and \nindexing"}
