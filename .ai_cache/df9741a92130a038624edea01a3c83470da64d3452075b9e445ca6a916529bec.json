A survey of 90 households revealed subscription details: 45 households subscribe to Netflix, 50 to \nAmazon Prime, 40 to Disney+, 20 subscribe to both Netflix and Amazon Prime, 15 to both Amazon \nPrime and Disney+, 18 to both Netflix and Disney+, Additionally, 8 households don\u2019t subscribe to any \nof these services. Determine: \ni) How many households subscribe to all three services? \nii) How many subscribe to exactly two? \niii) How many subscribe to only one service? \n6.

For a set X, demonstrate that the subset relation \u2286 on P(X) forms a partial order by verifying reflexivity, \nantisymmetry, and transitivity. \n9. Given, set \n . Give an example of a relation \n defined on the set A, which is: \n(i) reflexive and transitive but not symmetric \n(ii) symmetric and transitive but not reflexive \n(iii) reflexive and symmetric but not transitive \n(iv) reflexive and transitive but neither symmetric nor antisymmetric   \n10. Show that if a relation \n on set \n is asymmetric iff \n is irreflexive and antisymmetric. \n11.
