{"mtime": 1756288213.6591103, "text": "MySQL COMPANY Database Help (EMPLOYEE \u2192\n DEPENDENT)\n1. Fixing Schema Issues\n- In the EMPLOYEE table, foreign key constraints must point to valid values. - For example,\nDEPARTMENT.Mgr_ssn must reference an existing EMPLOYEE.Ssn. - If you insert a department\nbefore its manager exists in EMPLOYEE, it will fail.\n2. Department & Dept_Locations Fix\n- Insert managers into EMPLOYEE first (e.g., John Smith, Jennifer Wallace, Franklin Wong). - Then\ninsert DEPARTMENT rows referencing valid Mgr_ssn values. - After DEPARTMENT rows exist,\nyou can insert DEPT_LOCATIONS. - Error 1452 occurs if a DEPT_LOCATIONS.Dnumber does not\nexist in DEPARTMENT.\n3. Dependents Table\nThe DEPENDENT table typically looks like this: CREATE TABLE DEPENDENT ( Essn CHAR(9)\nNOT NULL, Dependent_name VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL, Sex CHAR(1), Bdate DATE,\nRelationship VARCHAR(8), PRIMARY KEY (Essn, Dependent_name), FOREIGN KEY (Essn)\nREFERENCES EMPLOYEE(Ssn) ); Important points: - Essn must exist in EMPLOYEE.Ssn. - If you\ninsert a dependent for an employee that does not exist, you get Error 1452 (foreign key constraint\nfails).\n4. Example Inserts\nExample (valid because '333445555' exists in EMPLOYEE.Ssn): INSERT INTO DEPENDENT\n(Essn, Dependent_name, Sex, Bdate, Relationship) VALUES ('333445555', 'Alice', 'F',\n'1986-04-05', 'Daughter'); If '333445555' does not exist in EMPLOYEE, this will fail with a foreign\nkey error. Always insert the employee first before their dependents.\n5. Troubleshooting\n- ERROR 1452: Foreign key constraint fails \u2192 The referenced parent row in EMPLOYEE or\nDEPARTMENT does not exist. - ERROR 1062: Duplicate entry \u2192 You tried to insert a department\nor dependent that already exists (check primary key). - Fix: Always insert parent rows (EMPLOYEE,\nDEPARTMENT) before child rows (DEPENDENT, DEPT_LOCATIONS).\n"}
