One of the features is: \n\u201cIf it is night or if the room is dark, and if someone is present, then the lights should \nturn on\u201d.  \nExpress this situation using propositional logic. Determine whether the system\u2019s \nbehavior is a tautology, contradiction, or contingency (true in some cases and \nfalse in others ) Justify your answer. \n \nCO1 1 \n2 Let P(x), Q(x), R(x), and S(x) be the statements \u201cx is a duck,\u201d \u201cx is one of my \npoultry,\u201d \u201cx is an officer,\u201d and \u201cx is willing to waltz,\u201d respectively. Express each of \nthese statements using quantifiers; logical connectives; and P (x), Q(x), R(x), and \nS(x).  \na) No ducks are willing to waltz.  \nb) No officers ever decline to waltz.  \nc) All my poultry are ducks.  \nd) My poultry are not officers. \n \nCO1 1 \n3 Determine whether the following argument is valid or fallacy.                      \nIf you do every problem in this book, then you will learn discrete mathematics.  \nYou learned discrete mathematics.  \nTherefore, you did every problem in this book. \n \nCO1 1 \n4 Suppose a chatbot is designed with the rule: \n\u201cA user can access the admin panel if and only if they are not an admin.\u201d \nAnalyze this proposition. Is it a contradiction? Explain with truth tables and a real-\nworld analogy. \nCO1 1 \n5  Write the converse, inverse, and contrapositive of some statements, which are \nshown below: \n1. If the weather is sunny, then I will go to school. \n2. If 3\ud835\udc66\u22122=10, then \ud835\udc65=1. \n3. If there is rainy weather, then I will go outside to enjoy it. \nCO1 1 \nName: \nEnrolment No: \n \n \n  \n6 Determine whether the argument given here is valid and determine whether its \nconclusion must be true because of the validity of the argument.  \n\u201cIf \u221a5>\u0b37\n\u0b36, then \u0d6b\u221a5\u0d6f\u0b36 >\u1240\u0b37\n\u0b36\u1241\n\u0b36\n.  We know that \u221a5 >\u0b37\n\u0b36 . Consequently, (\u221a5 )\u0b36 =\n5>\u1240\u0b37\n\u0b36\u1241\n\u0b36\n=\u0b3d\n\u0b38.\u201d \n \nCO1 1 \n7 A university course prerequisite structure is as follows: \n\uf0b7 Course A has no prerequisites. \n\uf0b7 Course B requires A. \n\uf0b7 Course C requires A. \n\uf0b7 Course D requires both B and C. \n\uf0b7 Course E requires B. \nDefine a partially ordered set (poset) where the relation R is \"is a prerequisite \nfor.\" \na) List all ordered pairs (\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc66) in the poset such that course \ud835\udc65 is a prerequisite \nfor course \ud835\udc66. \nb) Draw the Hasse diagram for this poset. \nc)   Is this poset a lattice? Explain your reasoning. \nd)  Identify the least upper bound and greatest lower bound, if any, for the \npair {B, C} in the poset. \n \n \n \nCO1 \n1 \n8 If \ud835\udc3a is a bipartite graph and the bipartition of \ud835\udc3a is \ud835\udc4b and \ud835\udc4c, then show that  \n\u2211 deg(\ud835\udc63) =\u0be9\u2208\u0bd1 \u2211 deg (\ud835\udc63)\u0be9\u2208\u0bd2 . \n \nCO3 1 \n9 A simple graph contains 35 edges, four vertices of degree 5, five vertices of \ndegree 4 and four vertices of degree 3. Find the number of vertices with degree 2 \n \n \nCO3 \n1 \n10 You are tasked with designing a computer network for a university campus with \nmultiple buildings. Each building has several departments. \na) Describe how you would model this network as a graph. Define what the \nvertices and edges represent. \nb) Would you use a directed or undirected graph? Explain your choice. \n \nCO3 1 \n "}
