[Not a Proposition] \n \n\u2022 A proposition is a sentence, written in a language, that has a truth value (i.e., it \nis true or false) in a world. A proposition is built from atomic propositions and \nlogical connectives. \n \n\u2022 An atomic proposition , or just an atom, is a symbol. Atoms are written as \nsequences of letters, digits, and the underscore (_) and start with a lower-case \nletter. \n \nSyntax and Semantics of Propositional Calculus \n \nThe syntax of Propositional logic/calculus consists of atomic symbols and logical connectives. \nAny symbol that represent a proposition and has true/false value is called as atomic symbol.  \ntrue, P , Q, R are all sentences  \n \nPropositional logic uses a symbolic \u201clanguage\u201d to represent the logical structure, or form, of a \ncompound proposition. Like any language, this symbolic language has rules of syntax\u2014\ngrammatical rules for putting symbols together in the right way. Any expression that obeys the \nsyntactic rules of propositional logic is called a well-formed formula, or WFF. \n \nDifferent Type of Connectives \n  \n \n \nNegation (Not) \n \n\uf0b7 It is a unary connective. It only takes one argument. \n\uf0b7 Any proposition can be prefixed by the word \u2018not\u2019 to form a second proposition called \nthe negation of the original. \n\uf0b7 Definition: If p is an arbitrary proposition then the negation of p is written \u00acp \n\uf0b7 Truth Table              \n\uf0a7  \n \nConjunction (AND) \n\uf0b7 Any two propositions can be combined to form a third proposition called the \n\uf0b7 conjunction of the original propositions. \n\uf0b7 Definition: If p and q are arbitrary propositions, then the conjunction of p and \n\uf0b7 q is written p ^ q and will be true iff both p and q are true. \n\uf0b7 Truth Table \n \n \n \nDisjunction (OR) \n\uf0b7 Any two propositions can be combined by the word \u2018or\u2019 to form a third proposition \n\n\uf0b7 called the disjunction of the originals. \n\uf0b7 Definition: If p and q are arbitrary propositions, then the disjunction of p and \n\uf0b7 q is written p V q and will be true iff either p is true, or q is  true, or both p and q are \ntrue. \n\uf0b7 Truth Table \n \n \nImplication (If..Then) \n\uf0b7 Many statements, particularly in mathematics, are of the form: \nif p is true then q is true. \n\uf0b7 Another way of saying the same thing is to write: p implies q. \n\uf0b7 In propositional logic, we have a connective that combines two propositions into a new \nproposition called the  conditional, or implication of the originals,  that attempts to \ncapture the sense of such a statement. \n\uf0b7 Definition: If p and q are arbitrary  propositions, then the conditional of p and q  is \nwritten \n\uf0b7 p \uf0e0 q and will be true iff either p is false or q is true. \n \n \nBiconditional (iff) \n\uf0b7 Another common form of statement in logic is: \np is true if, and only if, q is true. \n\uf0b7 The sense of such statements is captured using the biconditional operator. \n\uf0b7 Definition: If p and q are arbitrary propositions, then the biconditional of p \n\uf0b7 and q is written: p \uf0df\uf0e0 q and will be true iff either: \no p and q are both true; or \no p and q are both false. \n \n \n \n\uf0b7 In propositional logic, we use symbolic variables to represent the logic, and we can use \nany symbol for a representing a proposition, such A, B, C, P, Q, R, etc.  \n\uf0b7 Propositions can be either true or false, but it cannot be both.  \n\n\uf0b7 The propositions and connectives are the basic elements of the propositional logic.  \n\uf0b7 Connectives can be said as a logical operator which connects two sentences.  \n\uf0b7 A proposition formula which is always true is called tautology, and it is also called a \nvalid sentence.  \n\uf0b7 A proposition formula which is always false is called Contradiction. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n  \n\nPredicate Logic \n \n\uf0b7 Predicate Logic or First-order Predicate logic is another way of knowledge \nrepresentation in artificial intelligence. It is an extension to propositional logic. \n\uf0b7 FOPL is better in representing real world relations and  natural language statements in \na concise way. \n\uf0b7 First-order logic is a powerful language that develops information about the objects in \nan easier way and can also express the relationship between those objects. \n\uf0b7 First-order logic (like natural language) does not only assume that the world contains \nfacts like propositional logic but also assumes the following things in the world: \n \no Objects: Anything like A, B, people, numbers, colors, wars, theories, squares, \nare objects \no Relations: It can be unary relation such as: red, round, is adjacent, or n-ary \nrelation such as: the sister of, brother of, has color, comes between \no Function: Father of, best friend, third inning of, end of, \n \nComponents of FOPL \n\uf0b7 Predicates:  Predicates are statements that can be either true or false depending on the \nvalues of their arguments. They represent properties, relations, or characteristics of objects. \nFor example, \"IsHungry(x)\" can be a predicate, where \"x\" is a variable representing an object, \nand the predicate evaluates to true if that object is hungry. \nExample:  \nJohn is a man man(John) \n\uf0b7 Functions: Similar to predicates but has return values . Functions can have arguments \ncalled as arity. \no Computable functions: age(Bob), gT(x,y) \n\uf0b7 Variables \n\uf0b7 Terms \n\uf0b7 Constants \n \nQuantifiers \n\uf0b7 A quantifier is a language element which generates quantification, and quantification \nspecifies the quantity of specimen in the universe of discourse.  \n\uf0b7 These are the symbols that explains or identify the range and scope of the variable in the \nlogical expression.  \n\uf0b7 They are one of the most important notion in predicate logic, which is why it is also called \nas the quantified logic. The quantifiers give us the power to express propositions involving \nentire sets of objects, some of them, enumerate them, etc. \n \n1. Universal Quantifier, (for all, everyone, everything) \n2. Existential quantifier, (for some, at least one). \n1. Universal Quantifier \n\uf0b7 Universal quantifier is a symbol of logical representation, which specifies that the \nstatement within its range is true for everything or every instance of a particular thing. \n\uf0b7 The Universal quantifier is represented by a symbol \u2200, which resembles an inverted A. \n\uf0b7 In universal quantifier we use implication \"\u2192\" as connective. \n\uf0b7 If x is a variable, then \u2200x is read as: \no For all x \no For each x \no For every x \nExample  \nAll man drink coffee. \u2200x man(x) \u2192 drink (x, coffee). \n2. Existential Quantifier \n\uf0b7 Existential quantifiers are the type of quantifiers, which  express that the statement \nwithin its scope is true for at least one instance of something. \n\uf0b7 It is denoted by the logical operator \u2203, which resembles as  an inverted E. When it is \nused with a predicate variable then it is called as an existential quantifier. \n\uf0b7 If x is a variable, then existential quantifier will be \u2203x or \u2203(x). \n\uf0b7 In existential quantifier we use implication \"\u2227\" as connective \n\uf0b7 And it will be read as: \no There exists a 'x.' \no For some 'x.' \no For at least one 'x.\u201e \no Example: Some boys are intelligent. \u2203x: boys(x) \u2227 intelligent(x) \n \nExamples of predicate logic \n \nMarcus was a man.  \nman(Marcus).  \n \nMarcus was a Pompeian.  \nPompeian(Marcus).  \n \nAll Pompeians were Romans.  \n\u2200x : Pompeian(x) - > Roman(x).  \n \nCaesar was a ruler.  \nruler(Caesar).  \n \nAll Romans were either loyal to Caesar or hated him.  \n\u2200x :Roman(x) -> (LoyalTo(x,Caesar) \u2228 Hate(x,Caesar)) \nAll kings are persons \n\u2200x: King(x) \u21d2 Person(x)  \nFor all x, if x is a king, then x is a person \nNested Quantifier \nEverybody loves somebody \n\u2200 x \u2203 y: Loves(x, y) \nThere is someone who is loved by everyone \n\u2203 y \u2200 x: Loves(x, y) \nBrothers are siblings \n\u2200 x \u2200 y: Brother(x, y) \u21d2 Sibling(x, y) \n \n \n \n"}
