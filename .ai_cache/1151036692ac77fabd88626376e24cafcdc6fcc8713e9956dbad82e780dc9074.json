Similarly, a\ncourse on operating systems is an essential part of any computer science edu-\ncation. Thisfieldisundergoingrapidchange, ascomputersarenow prevalent\nin virtually every arena of day-to-day life\u2014from embedded devices in auto-\nmobiles through the most sophisticated planning tools for governments and\nmultinationalfirms. Yetthe fundamental concepts remainfairly clear,and it is\non these that we base this book.\nWe wrote this book as a text for an introductory course in operating sys-\ntems at the junior or senior undergraduate level or at the first-year graduate\nlevel. We hope that practitioners will also find it useful. It provides a clear\ndescription of theconcepts that underlie operating systems. As prerequisites,\nwe assume that the reader is familiar with basic data structures, computer\norganization,andahigh-levellanguage,suchasCorJava.Thehardwaretopics\nrequired for an understanding of operating systems are covered in Chapter 1.\nInthatchapter,wealsoincludeanoverviewofthefundamentaldatastructures\nthat are prevalent in most operating systems. For code examples, we use pre-\ndominantly C, as well as a significant amount of Java, but the reader can still\nunderstandthealgorithmswithoutathoroughknowledgeoftheselanguages.\nConcepts are presented using intuitive descriptions. Important theoretical\nresults are covered, but formal proofs are largely omitted. The bibliographical\nnotes at the end of each chapter contain pointers to research papers in which\nresultswerefirstpresentedandproved,aswellasreferencestorecentmaterial\nforfurtherreading.Inplaceofproofs,figuresandexamplesareusedtosuggest\nwhy we should expect the result in question to be true.\nThe fundamental concepts and algorithms covered in the book are often\nbased on those used in both open-source and commercial operating systems.\nOur aim is to present these concepts and algorithms in a general setting that\nis not tied to one particular operating system. However, we present a large\nnumber of examplesthat pertainto themost popularand themost innovative\noperating systems, including Linux, Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS (the\noriginalname, OSX,waschangedin2016tomatchthenamingschemeofother\nApple products), and Solaris. We also include examples of both Android and\niOS, currently the two dominant mobile operating systems.\nThe organization of the text reflects our many years of teaching courses\non operating systems. Consideration was also given to the feedback provided\nvii\nviii Preface\nby the reviewers of the text, along with the many comments and suggestions\nwe received from readers of our previous editions and from our current and\nformerstudents.ThisTenthEditionalsoreflectsmostofthecurriculumguide-\nlinesintheoperating-systemsareain Computer Science Curricula 2013,themost\nrecentcurriculumguidelinesforundergraduatedegreeprogramsincomputer\nsciencepublishedbythe IEEEComputingSocietyandtheAssociationforCom-\nputing Machinery (ACM).\nWhat\u2019s New in This Edition\nFor the Tenth Edition, we focused on revisions and enhancements aimed at\nlowering costs to the students, better engaging them in the learning process,\nand providing increased support for instructors.\nAccording tothe publishing industry\u2019smost trustedmarketresearchfirm,\nOutsell, 2015 represented a turning point in text usage: for the first time,\nstudentpreferencefordigitallearningm aterialswashigherthanforprint,and\nthe increase in preference for digital has been accelerating since.\nWhileprintremainsimportantformanystudentsasapedagogicaltool,the\nTenth Edition is being deliveredin forms that emphasize support for learning\nfromdigitalmaterials.Allformsweareprovidingdramaticallyreducethecost\nto students compared to the Ninth Edition.

It does not, however, include\nthe appendices, the regular exercises, the solutions to the practice exercises,\nthe programming problems, the programming projects, and some of the other\nenhancements found in this ePub electronic book.\nContent of This Book\nThe text is organized in ten major parts:\n\u2022 Overview. Chapters 1 and 2 explain what operating systems are, what\nthey do, and how they are designed and constructed. These chapters dis-\ncuss what the common features of an operating system are and what an\noperating system does for the user. We include coverage of both tradi-\ntional PC and server operating systems and operating systems for mobile\ndevices. The presentation is motivational and explanatory in nature. We\nhaveavoidedadiscussionofhowthingsaredoneinternallyinthesechap-\nters. Therefore, they are suitable for individual readers or for students in\nlower-levelclasseswhowanttolearnwhatanoperatingsystemiswithout\ngetting into the details of the internal algorithms.\n\u2022 Process management. Chapters 3 through 5 describe the process concept\nand concurrency as the heart of modern operating systems. Aprocess is\nthe unit of work in a system. Such a system consists of a collection of\nconcurrently executing processes, some executing operating-system code\nandothersexecutingusercode.Thesechapterscovermethodsforprocess\nscheduling and interprocess communication. Also included is a detailed\ndiscussion of threads,aswellas an examinationof issuesrelatedto multi-\ncore systems and parallel programming.\n\u2022 Process synchronization.Chapters6through8covermethodsforprocess\nsynchronization and deadlock handling. Because we have increased the\ncoverageofprocesssynchronization,wehavedividedtheformerChapter\n5 (Process Synchronization) into two separate chapters: Chapter 6, Syn-\nchronization Tools, and Chapter 7, Synchronization Examples.\n\u2022 Memory management. Chapters 9 and 10 deal with the management of\nmain memory during the execution of a process. To improve both the\nx Preface\nutilization of theCPU and the speed of its response to its users, the com-\nputer must keep several processes in memory. There are many different\nmemory-management schemes, reflecting various approaches to memory\nmanagement, and the effectiveness of a particular algorithm depends on\nthe situation.\n\u2022 Storage management. Chapters11 and 12 describehow mass storage and\nI/O arehandledinamoderncomputersystem.The I/O devicesthatattach\nto a computer vary widely, and the operating system needs to provide a\nwide range of functionality to applications to allow them to control all\naspects of these devices. We discuss systemI/O in depth, includingI/O\nsystem design, interfaces, and internal system structures and functions.\nIn many ways,I/O devices are the slowest major components of the com-\nputer. Because they represent a performance bottleneck, we also examine\nperformance issues associated withI/O devices.\n\u2022 File systems.Chapters13through15discusshowfilesystemsarehandled\ninamoderncomputersystem.Filesystemsprovidethemechanismforon-\nlinestorageofandaccesstobothdataandprograms.Wedescribetheclas-\nsicinternalalgorithmsandstructuresofstoragemanagementandprovide\na firm practical understanding of the algorithms used\u2014their properties,\nadvantages, and disadvantages.\n\u2022 Security and protection.Chapters16and 17 discussthe mechanisms nec-\nessary for the security and protection of computer systems. The processes\nin an operating system must be protected from one another\u2019s activities.\nTo provide such protection, we must ensure that only processes that have\ngained proper authorization from the operating system can operate on\nthe files, memory,CPU, and other resources of the system. Protection is\na mechanism for controlling the access of programs, processes, or users\nto computer-system resources. This mechanism must provide a means\nof specifying the controls to be imposed, as well as a means of enforce-\nment.Securityprotectstheintegrityoftheinformationstoredinthesystem\n(both dataand code), aswellasthe physical resourcesof the system,from\nunauthorized access, malicious destruction or alteration, and accidental\nintroduction of inconsistency.\n\u2022 Advanced topics . Chapters 18 and 19 discuss virtual machines and\nnetworks/distributed systems. Chapter 18 provides an overview of\nvirtual machines and their relationship to contemporary operating\nsystems. Included is a general description of the hardware and software\ntechniques that make virtualization possible. Chapter 19 provides an\noverview of computer networks and distributed systems, with a focus on\nthe Internet andTCP/IP.\n\u2022 Case studies. Chapter 20 and 21 present detailed case studies of two real\noperating systems\u2014Linux and Windows 10.\n\u2022 Appendices. Appendix Adiscusses several old influential operating sys-\ntems that are no longer in use. Appendices B through D cover in great\ndetaisl three older operating systems\u2014 Windows 7,BSD,a n dM a c h .\nPreface xi\nProgramming Environments\nThe text provides several example programs written in C and Java. These\nprograms are intended to run in the following programming environments:\n\u2022 POSIX. POSIX (which stands forPortable Operating System Interface )r e p r e -\nsents a set of standards implemented primarily forUNIX-based operat-\ning systems. Although Windows systems can also run certainPOSIX pro-\ngrams, our coverage ofPOSIX focuses on Linux andUNIX systems. POSIX-\ncompliant systems must implement thePOSIX core standard (POSIX.1);\nLinux and macOS are examples ofPOSIX-compliant systems. POSIX also\ndefinesseveralextensionstothestandards,includingreal-timeextensions\n(POSIX.1b) and an extension for a threads library (POSIX.1c, better known\nas Pthreads). We provide several programming examples written in C\nillustrating thePOSIX base API,a sw e l la sP t h r e a d sa n dt h ee x t e n s i o n sf o r\nreal-timeprogramming.TheseexampleprogramsweretestedonLinux4.4\nand macOS 10.11 systems using thegcccompiler.\n\u2022 Java. Java is a widely used programming language with a richAPI and\nbuilt-in language support for concurrent and parallel programming. Java\nprograms runon any operatingsystemsupporting aJava virtualmachine\n(orJVM).Weillustratevariousoperating-systemandnetworkingconcepts\nwith Java programs tested using Version 1.8 of the Java Development Kit\n(JDK).\n\u2022 Windows systems.TheprimaryprogrammingenvironmentforWindows\nsystemsisthe Windows API, whichprovidesa comprehensivesetoffunc-\ntions for managing processes, threads, memory, and peripheral devices.\nWesupplyamodestnumberofCprogramsillustratingtheuseofthis API.\nPrograms were tested on a system running Windows 10.\nWe have chosen these three programming environments because we\nbelieve that they best represent the two most popular operating-system\nmodels\u2014Linux/UNIX and Windows\u2014along with the widely used Java\nenvironment. Most programming examples are written in C, and we expect\nreaders to be comfortable with this language. Readers familiar with both the\nC and Java languages should easily understand most programs provided in\nthis text.\nIn some instances\u2014such as thread creation\u2014we illustrate a specific con-\ncept using all three programming environments, allowing the reader to con-\ntrast the three different libraries as they address the same task. In other situa-\ntions, we may use just one of theAPIs to demonstrate a concept. For example,\nwe illustrate shared memory using just thePOSIX API; socket programming in\nTCP/IP is highlighted using the JavaAPI.\nLinux Virtual Machine\nTo help students gain a better understanding of the Linux system, we pro-\nvide a Linux virtual machine running the Ubuntu distribution with this text.\nThe virtual machine, which is available for download from the text website\nxii Preface\n(http://www.os-book.com),also providesdevelopmentenvironments includ-\ning thegcc and Java compilers. Most of the programming assignments in the\nbookcanbecompletedusingthisvirtual machine,withtheexceptionofassign-\nments that requirethe WindowsAPI. The virtual machine can be installedand\nrun on any host operating system that can run the VirtualBox virtualization\nsoftware, which currently includes Windows 10 Linux, and macOS.\nThe Tenth Edition\nAswewrotethisTenthEditionof Operating System Concepts,wewereguidedby\nthe sustained growth in four fundamental areas that affect operating systems:\n1. Mobile operating systems\n2. Multicore systems\n3. Virtualization\n4. Nonvolatile memory secondary storage\nTo emphasize these topics, we have integrated relevant coverage throughout\nthis new edition. For example, we have greatly increased our coverage of the\nAndroid and iOS mobile operating systems, as well as our coverage of the\nARMv8 architecture that dominates mobile devices. We have also increased\nour coverage of multicore systems, including increased coverage ofAPIst h a t\nprovidesupportforconcurrencyandparallelism.Nonvolatilememorydevices\nlikeSSDs are now treatedas the equals of hard-disk drivesin the chapters that\ndiscussI/O, mass storage, and file systems.\nSeveral of our readers have expressed support for an increase in Java\ncoverage, and we have provided additional Java examples throughout this\nedition.\nAdditionally,wehaverewrittenmaterialinalmosteverychapterbybring-\ning older material up to date and removing material that is no longer interest-\ningorrelevant.Wehavereorderedmanychaptersandhave,insomeinstances,\nmoved sections from one chapter to another. We have also greatly revised\nthe artwork, creating several new figures as well as modifying many existing\nfigures.\nMajor Changes\nThe Tenth Edition update encompasses much more material than previous\nupdates, in terms of both content and new supporting material. Next, we\nprovide a brief outline of the major content changes in each chapter:\n\u2022 Chapter 1: Introductionincludes updatedcoverageof multicoresystems,\nas well as new coverage ofNUMA systems and Hadoop clusters. Old\nmaterial has been updated, and new motivation has been added for the\nstudy of operating systems.\n\u2022 Chapter 2: Operating-System Structures provides a significantly revised\ndiscussion of the design and implementation of operating systems. We\nhave updated our treatment of Android and iOS and have revised our\nPreface xiii\ncoverage of the system boot process with a focus onGRUB for Linux\nsystems. New coverage of the Windows subsystem for Linux is included\nas well. We have added new sections on linkers and loaders, and we now\ndiscuss why applications are often operating-system specific. Finally, we\nhave addeda discussion of theBCCdebugging toolset.\n\u2022 Chapter 3: Processes simplifies the discussion of scheduling so that it\nnow includes onlyCPU scheduling issues. New coverage describes the\nmemory layout of a C program, the Android process hierarchy, Mach\nmessage passing, and AndroidRPCs. We have also replaced coverage of\nthe traditionalUNIX/Linux initprocess with coverage ofsystemd.\n\u2022 Chapter 4: Threads and Concurrency (previously Threads) increases the\ncoverage of support for concurrent and parallel programming at theAPI\nand library level. We have revised the section on Java threads so that it\nnow includes futures and have updated the coverage of Apple\u2019s Grand\nCentralDispatchsothat itnow includesSwift.Newsectionsdiscussfork-\njoin parallelism using the fork-join framework in Java, as well as Intel\nthread building blocks.\n\u2022 Chapter 5: CPU Scheduling(previouslyChapter6)revisesthecoverageof\nmultilevelqueueandmulticoreprocessingscheduling.Wehaveintegrated\ncoverage of NUMA-aware scheduling issues throughout, including how\nthis scheduling affects load balancing.
