Unification is a key concept in proofs by resolutions.\n\u2022 Resolution is a single inference rule which can efficiently operate on the conjunctive normal form or clausal\nform.\n\u2022 Clause: Disjunction of literals (an atomic sentence) is called a clause. It is also known as a unit clause.\n\u2022 Conjunctive Normal Form: A sentence represented as a conjunction of clauses is said to be conjunctive normal\nform or CNF.\n\u2022 Steps for Resolution:\nConversion of facts into first-order logic.\n1.Convert FOL statements into CNF\n2.Negate the statement which needs to prove (proof by contradiction)\n3.Draw resolution graph (unification).\nAlgorithm: Convert to Clause Form\n1. Eliminate \u2192, using the fact that a \u2192 b is equivalent to \u00ac a V b.\n2. Reduce the scope of each \u00ac to a single term, using the fact that\n\u2022 \u00ac (\u00ac p) = p\n\u2022 deMorgan\u2019s laws [which say that \u00ac (a ^ b) = \u00ac a V \u00ac b and \u00ac (a V b) = \u00ac a ^ \u00ac b ],\n\u2022 and the standard correspondences between quantifiers [\u00ac \u2200x: P(x) = \u018ex: \u00ac P(x) and \u00ac \u018ex:\nP(x) = Vx: \u00acP(x)].\n3. Standardize variables so that each quantifier binds a unique variable. Since variables are just\ndummy names, this process cannot affect the truth value of the wff. For example, the formula\n\u2200x: P(x) V \u2200x: Q(x) would be converted to \u2200x: P(x) V \u2200y: Q(y)\n4. Move all quantifiers to the left of the formula without changing their relative order. This is\npossible since there is no conflict among variable names.\n5. Eliminate existential quantifiers: This process is performed by introducing functions called as Skolem functions in place \nof existential quantifiers. The process is called as Skolemization(remove existential quantifiers by introducing new \nfunction symbols). Ex: \u018ey : President(y) can be transformed into the formula President(S1) where S1 is the function.\n6. Drop the prefix At this point, all remaining variables are universally quantified, so the prefix can just be dropped and any\nproof procedure we use can simply assume that any variable it sees is universally quantified.\n7. Convert the matrix into a conjunction of disjuncts.\n8. Create a separate clause corresponding to each conjunct\nResolution in Propositional Logic \n\u2022 In order to make it clear how resolution works, let us understand it the resolution procedure for \npropositional logic. \n\u2022 In propositional logic, the procedure for producing a proof by resolution of proposition P with \nrespect to a set of axioms F is the following, \nAlgorithm: Propositional Resolution \n1. Convert all the propositions of F to clause form. \n2. Negate P and convert the result to clause form. Add it to the set of clauses obtained in step 1. \n3. Repeat until either a contradiction is found or no progress can be made: \na) Select two clauses. Call these the parent clauses. \nb) Resolve them together. The resulting clause, called the resolvent, will be the disjunction of all \nof the literals of both of the parent clauses with the following exception: If there are any pairs \nof literals L and -IL such that one of the parent clauses contains L and the other contains -IL, \nthen select one such pair and eliminate both L and from the resolvent. \nc) If the resolvent is the empty clause, then a contradiction has been found. If it is not, then add it \nto the set of clauses available to the procedure. \n\n\nExample Propositional logic resolution \n1. The-humidity-is-high or the-sky-is-cloudy.\n2.
