Why Data Exploration?\n\uf06c Key motivations of data exploration include\n\u2013 Getting a better understanding of the data\n\u2013 Create background knowledge about the data to be analyzed\n\u2013 Helping to select the right tool for preprocessing, data analysis and data \nmining\n\u2013 Making use of humans\u2019 abilities to recognize patterns\n\uf075 People can recognize patterns not captured by data analysis tools\n\uf06c Related to the area of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\u2013 Created by statistician John Tukey\n\u2013 Seminal book is Exploratory Data Analysis by Tukey\n\u2013 A nice online introduction can be found in Chapter 1 of the NIST \nEngineering Statistics Handbook\nhttp://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/index.htm\nA preliminary exploration of the data to better \nunderstand its characteristics.\nTan,Steinbach, Kumar: Exploratory Data Analysis (with major  modifications and additions by Ch.

Summary Statistics\n\uf06c Summary statistics  are numbers that summarize \nproperties of the data\n\u2013 Summarized properties include frequency, location and \nspread\n\uf075 Examples: location - mean\nspread - standard deviation\n\u2013 Most summary statistics can be calculated in a single \npass through the data\nTan,Steinbach, Kumar: Exploratory Data Analysis (with major  modifications and additions by Ch. Eick)                               9/9/2025\nFrequency and Mode\n\uf06c The frequency of an attribute value is the \npercentage of time the value occurs in the \ndata set\n\u2013 For example, given the attribute \u2018gender\u2019 and a \nrepresentative population of people, the gender \n\u2018female\u2019 occurs about 50% of the time.\n\uf06c The mode of a an attribute is the most frequent \nattribute value   \n\uf06c The notions of frequency and mode are typically \nused with categorical data\nTan,Steinbach, Kumar: Exploratory Data Analysis (with major  modifications and additions by Ch. Eick)                               9/9/2025\nPercentiles\n\uf06c For continuous data, the notion of a percentile is \nmore useful. \nGiven an ordinal or continuous attribute x and a \nnumber p between 0 and 100, the pth percentile is \na value     of x such that p% of the observed \nvalues of x are less than    . \n\uf06c For instance, the 50th percentile is the value      \nsuch that 50% of all values of x are less than      .\n\uf06c Key Idea: associate attribute value with a rank!!\n  \n\uf0a0\uf020\nxp\n  \n\uf0a0\uf020\nxp\n  \n\uf0a0\uf020\nxp\n  \n\uf0a0\uf020\nx50%\n  \n\uf0a0\uf020\nx50%\nTan,Steinbach, Kumar: Exploratory Data Analysis (with major  modifications and additions by Ch.

Eick)                               9/9/2025\nMeasures of Spread: Range and Variance\n\uf06c Range is the difference between the max and min\n\uf06c The variance or standard deviation\n\uf06c However, this is also sensitive to outliers, so that \nother measures are often used.  \n \n(Mean Absolute Deviation) [Han]\n(Absolute Average Deviation) [Tan]\n(Median Absolute Deviation)\nstandard_deviation(x)= sx\n0, 2, 3, 7, 8\n11.5\n3.3\n2.8\n3\n5\nTan,Steinbach, Kumar: Exploratory Data Analysis (with major  modifications and additions by Ch.

Visualization\nVisualization is the conversion of data into a visual \nor tabular format so that the characteristics of the \ndata and the relationships among data items or \nattributes can be analyzed or reported.\n\uf06c Visualization of data is one of the most powerful \nand appealing techniques for data exploration. \n\u2013 Humans have a well developed ability to analyze large \namounts of information that is presented visually\n\u2013 Can detect general patterns and trends\n\u2013 Can detect outliers and unusual patterns   \nTan,Steinbach, Kumar: Exploratory Data Analysis (with major  modifications and additions by Ch.
