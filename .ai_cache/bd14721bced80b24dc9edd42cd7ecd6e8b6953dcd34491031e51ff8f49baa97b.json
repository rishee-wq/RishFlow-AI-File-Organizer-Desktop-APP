What is the minimum no. of students we have to choose randomly \nfrom department to ensure that a student club is formed? \nCO2 1 \n2 A computation is divided among three processors that can only handle small \nnumbers: \n\uf0b7 Processor 1 computes results mod 13 \n\uf0b7 Processor 2 computes results mod 17 \n\uf0b7 Processor 3 computes results mod 19 \nThe partial results for some computation are 9, 4, and 11 respectively. \n \n(a) Use CRT to reconstruct the overall result mod 13 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 19. \n \n(b) Discuss one real-world scenario (e.g., cryptography or data storage) where this \napproach improves efficiency. \n \nCO2 1 \n3 Three planets revolve around a star with orbital periods of 15, 20, and 28 years \nrespectively. \n \n Use the least common multiple and CRT to determine after how many years all \nthree will align again. \n \nCO2 1 \n4 Suppose a server uses a 10-digit hash to label uploaded files. If 1 million files are \nuploaded, prove using the Pigeonhole Principle that at least two files share a hash \nvalue. \n \nCO2 1 \n5 Two groups of students, one with 48 members and the other with 64 members, are \nto be organized into the largest possible equal-sized teams. Each team should have \nstudents from only one group. What is the largest number of students that can be \nin each team? \nCO2 1 \n  \nApplied Science Cluster, Mathematics \n \n \n \n  \n6 A data center adds servers each week according to \ud835\udc46\u0be1 =2\ud835\udc46\u0be1\u0b3f \u0b35 +1, starting with \n1 server. \n(a) Find the closed form for \ud835\udc46\u0be1. \n(b) Use induction to prove your result. \n \nCO2 1 \n7 Four radio towers are placed at the corners of a square and one in the center. \nEach tower must be assigned a frequency such that adjacent towers do not share \nthe same frequency. \n \n(a) Model this as a graph coloring problem. \n(b) Apply the Welch\u2013Powell algorithm to find the chromatic number. \n(c) Suggest a real-world meaning of the chromatic number in communication \nsystems. \n \n \nCO3 \n1 \n8 Your university campus has 8 important landmarks connected by walkways. \n(a) Construct a graph of the locations. \n(b) Determine whether it has a Hamiltonian cycle. \n(c) Suggest how this could help plan a guided tour or robot navigation route. \n \nCO3 1 \n9 Apply Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm to determine the length of the shortest path and hence \nthe shortest path in the given graph from 0 to 4: \n \n                          \n \n \nCO4 \n1 \n10 Real-world networks (like transportation or communication networks) are often \nsparse. Choose a dataset of your choice and: \n\uf0b7 Compute its density. \n\uf0b7 Comment on what the sparsity implies for the system\u2019s structure and \ndynamics. \n \nCO4 1 \n \n"}
